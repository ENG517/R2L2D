Send Your Results to Another Location

When you execute a program in SAS Studio, you can download the output from the Results tab to your local machine. If you want to send your output directly to another location, you must open your own ODS destination. By default, output files that are generated by the ODS destinations that you open are written to your home directory.

If you want to send the results to a specific location, use a FILENAME statement to define a file reference to the desired location. You can use the &_SASWS_ macro variable to reference your home directory. After you create the file reference, use the PATH=file-reference option in your ODS statement. Here is an example:
filename odsout "&_SASWS_/charts";
ods _all_ close;
ods html path=odsout file="sales.htm";
