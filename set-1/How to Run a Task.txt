4. If the Data tab is available, specify an input data source and select columns for the roles in the data source. A role is a description of a variableâ€™s purpose in the task. To add a column to a role, click Select columns. A list of available columns for that role appears. If only one column can be assigned to the role, you select a column and the list disappears. If multiple columns can be assigned, you can press Ctrl or Shift to select multiple columns from the list and click OK.

5. On the remaining tabs, specify any other required options, which are denoted with a red asterisk. As you assign values to the task, the relevant SAS code is generated. For more information about the options available for each task, see SAS Studio: Task Reference Guide.

Tip: The Task Console displays any information required to run the task.

6. To run the task, click Submit code.
