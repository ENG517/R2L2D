# Lesson Outline

**Objectives**:

1. Understand readers and tasks and how to accommodate both when writing technical content.
2. Practice Github editorial workflow, as we do #1

## GitHub and VS Code

Let's practice some GitHub basics (repos, branching, commits, pull requests, merging).

Before we begin, COPY and PASTE a new version of this file. Replace `TOCOPY` with your `lastname`. For me, my file will be named `audience-lindgren.md`.

As we work through this material about Redish, let's practice how to use git/Github to work with an editorial workflow.

- [ ] Clone a repo in GitHub Desktop (including file location)
- [ ] Fetching files from GitHub
- [ ] Branching the repo
- [ ] Creating a pull request to discuss changes and push changes
- [ ] Reviewing and merging changes in GitHub

## Carryover Discussion

**Question**: what ideas and concepts did you note as interesting or helpful from Hart-Davidson of van der Meij et al.?

**Question**: what questions do you have about Lakatos' editorial workflow and GH?

## Redish - Three Types of Readers

### Overview

Redish (1989) – three types of readers with different purposes and that are accommodated in different ways through the text

- Read to do: Reading to extract information for immediate use. No need to recall, little patience for long passages
- Read to learn: Reading for understanding and to recall later.  More patience for explanation and longer passages
- Read to learn to do: Read to understand and later recall in the context of their own tasks. Will read longer passages but need a context of a real tasks and sense of motivation. Readers will satisfice.

### Discussion 1 - Expectations

How do you expect that texts accommodating these readers will differ either in content or style? What specific, observable differences would you expect?

Differences in content can include the extent of material included. For example, the background within staging moves may have a smaller scope to focus on vs. a reading to learn document. Reading to learn to do seems to be more comprehensive. In the context of my project, I would see them as the following:

Reading to do: step-by-step for connecting a laptop to the systems in the landing
* this would be a specific "do this, then do this, then do this."

Reading to learn: guide for how to use the privacy screens, liughts, sound systems, and screens to support a wellness event
* this would focus on the different pieces of the space fitting into a bigger picture

Reading to learn to do: how to use the space to host an event
* this would be a version that keeps the even as the center focus, allowing for mroe curation of content and style depending on its use. This would be for more forward-facing documents that change in style depending on the event's formality and caliber

### Discussion 2 - Still Relevant?

Do Redish's categories of readers still matter 30 years later? Why or why not? Jot down some notes.

- Readers are information foragers
- Readers want information in isolated, portable chunks
- Readers access and interpret information through the lens of communities
- Readers pull content rather than having it pushed on them
- Readers use information to collaborate/cooperate with others

## E1. Understanding Audience

### E1.1 - Read some user doc excerpts

I have uploaded pieces of documentation from the *SAS Studio* software. Read them all and tell me the following:

- Which of these are for a *read to do* audience? (`set-?` folder)
- Which of these are for a *read to learn* audience? (`set-?` folder)
- Which of these are for a *read to learn to do* audience? (`set-?` folder)

### E1.2 - Analyzing properties of the texts

Discuss the questions below for analysis and try to integrate the WTGA language about staging, coaching, and alerting.

- What do the “Read to do” texts do in common?
- What do the “Read to learn to do” texts do in common?
- What do the “Read to learn” texts do in common?
- Overall, How do the groups differ from each other stylistically?

## More Redish - Understanding Readers

From another publication by Ginny Redish, she further characterizes what we need to know about audiences:

“Readers decide how much attention to page to a document” (p. 15)
- Readers only read as much as they need to read
- Make sure they get what they want before leaving
- Be sure of why you are writing to them

“Readers use documents as tools” (p. 18)
- Readers read in order to do something other than read
- Readers want information quickly
- Readers rely on tools/structures for access

“Readers actively interpret as they read” (p. 22)
- Readers bring their own needs, biases, and expectations
- Readers are situated in their tasks
- Understand these interpretations and shape them by addressing them

“Readers interpret documents in light of their own knowledge and expectations” (p. 27)
- Apply schema or rules for understanding the content
- Plan ahead and provide your own explicit schema
- Understand readers well enough to accommodate their schema (p.27)

**Discussion**: what are things that you could do (or have) done in technical writing to accommodate audiences with these characteristics?

## E2. Accommodating an Audience

> **Scenario**: You are enrolled in a class that is difficult to get into but you really want a seat in a different class that is waitlisted. The two classes are at the same day and time so you can't enroll in both. How can you set up your register for the waitlisted class automatically while dropping the course you are currently in.

### E2.1. Open NCSU's Student User Guide

Go to the [Student User Guide](https://sis.emas.ncsu.edu/students/) for MyPack Portal.

### E2.2. Search the site/page

Search however you can on the NC State site. Choose the first link that goes to a page of content from *Student Services*.

### E2.3. Evaluate result without scrolling

Evaluate the site without scrolling:

1. How likely is it that this page has the information you seek?
2. Is this page worth the energy spent to review the content?

### E2.4. Scroll and browse the rest of the content

Scroll and browse the rest of the content with the follow questions in mind:

1. How does the page either assure you that you have found the information you seek?
2. If the page does not have the information you seek, does it re-direct you?
3. To what degree is the page written to accommodate your needs/biases?
4. How well does the page work as "page one"?
